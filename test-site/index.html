    <h3>Pretty chuffed</h3>
    <p>The three-toed sloths are arboreal neotropical mammals (also known as "three-fingered" sloths).
        They are the only members of the genus Bradypus and the family Bradypodidae. 
        The four living species of three-toed sloths are the brown-throated sloth, the maned sloth, 
        the pale-throated sloth, and the pygmy three-toed sloth. 
        In complete contrast to past morphological studies, 
        which tended to place Bradypus as the sister group to all other folivorans, 
        molecular studies place them nested within the sloth superfamily Megatherioidea, 
        making them the only surviving members of that radiation</p>
        <p>Their scientific classification is</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Family-Bradypodidae</li>
            <li>Genus-Bradypus</li>
        </ul>
